# emoji-committer

A CLI tool that makes commits on a random repository of a Github user using emojis.

## How to run

For now, since this project is stil in development, and doesn't have a working/functional version, there is a `shell script` called `compile_and_run.sh` which can be used to run it.

You can do it like this:

```
./compile_and_run.sh
```

It is an executable already (`chmod +x`).

For now I am using `clang` to compile the code.
